# LIBRIS

Libris, meaning books in Latin, is a book review website designed to users can make reviews on books they already have read or find their next book from other users reviews.

## UX

### Strategy Plane

Being Libris a book review website the UX can be divided in people who have read a book and what to review it, people who are looking for a new book to read and the website owner.

* As a reader that finished a book I expect to be able to find or add the book I read and be able to add a comment to it's page in order to share my thoughts about it.
* As a reader looking for a new book to read I expect to find books sorted by genre and to have not only a small description of each book, but also some reviews from other readers.
* As the site owner I expect that this website will turn profitable by providing an affiliate "Buy me" link for each book.

### Scope Plane

Considering the User Stories in the Strategy Plane it is important that the website has the following:
* A set of books with the book cover, author, description, date of publishing and genre;
* The possibility to add new books and edit or delete existing ones (in case of error or duplication for example);
* The possibility to comment the existing books to give them a review;
* A way to sort through books based on author or genre;
* The possibility to click a link and go directly to the store to buy said book.

### Surface Plane

The links present in the footer icons actually take the user to the homepage of each social media since I didn't really create a social media page for my website.
