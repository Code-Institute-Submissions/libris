Libris, meaning books in Latin, is a book review website designed to users can make reviews on books they already have read or find their next book from other users reviews.

## UX

Being Libris a book review website the UX can be divided in people who have read a book and what to review it, people who are looking for a new book to read and the website owner.

- As a reader that finished a book I expect to be able to find or add the book I read and be able to add a comment to it's page in order to share my thoughts about it.
- As a reader looking for a new book to read I expect to find books sorted by genre and to have not only a small description of each book, but also some reviews from other readers.
- As the site owner I expect that this website will turn profitable by providing an affiliate "Buy me" link for each book.
